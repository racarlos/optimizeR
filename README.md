## Description
- A simplex optimizer, polynomial regression, and quadratic spline interpolation tool written in R with the Rshiny library for GUI.

## Notes 
- Simplex Algorithm is capped at 200 iterations to see if there is a feasible solution thus resulting to a slight delay.
- Entering characters and symbols in the simplex may cause error.
- Sample Inputs are located in the sample inputs folder.
- Use app.R to launch the program.
